# original email:
#
#  "You're 100% correct that the download managers are only giving you 200
#  records because that's the unauthenticated limit within TIND and these
#  other tools can't manage that. There will be some improvements made to
#  this area of the system in the future but in the meantime, we thought it
#  might be helpful to provide you with a pagination script that should allow
#  you to export large sets of records within the opac without the browser
#  timing out.
